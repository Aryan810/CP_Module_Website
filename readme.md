### 2: backend - a simple script which fetches user data from codeforces. for now, -> 
#### -> Name, Image (recommended. ), Institue, rating, maxrating, questions, solved. (any other if possible.)

# These are just for reference, may include more (or maybe less).

### 1: frontend - building a basic profile page in frontend.
#### -> show Name, Rating, Max-rating, Image, Designation, etc.

### 2: backend - make a API endpoint which fetches user details from codeforces (for now) and if frontend makes a request at it. it returns that. (DONE)
#### -> also make a role based authentication system. which uses mongoDB to store user details and password is hashed for security. (DONE)
#### -> login/logout functionality (DONE)..only now we need to sync them in frontend.
#### -> migrated frontend from Create React App (CRA) to Vite for better performance and modern tooling. (DONE)
(Is this workflow ok ? - [ ? ]).

### Frontend Migration to Vite (COMPLETED)
#### -> Successfully migrated from Create React App to Vite
#### -> Updated all React components to use .jsx extensions for better Vite compatibility
#### -> Configured Vite with React plugin, port 3000, and build output to 'build' directory
#### -> All existing functionality preserved: routing, authentication UI, responsive design
#### -> Development server now starts faster with hot module replacement
