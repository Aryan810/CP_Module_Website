### 1: frontend - building a basic UI for a user profile (may use copilot or GPT to do faster.)
#### -> keep all class names and id meaning full, so that it would be easy to handle for backend.

### 2: backend - a simple script which fetches user data from codeforces. for now, -> 
#### -> Name, Image (recommended. ), Institue, rating, maxrating, questions, solved. (any other if possible.)

# These are just for reference, may include more (or maybe less).

### 1: frontend - building a basic profile page in frontend.
#### -> show Name, Rating, Max-rating, Image, Designation, etc.

### 2: backend - make a API endpoint which fetches user details from codeforces (for now) and if frontend makes a request at it. it returns that. (DONE)
#### -> also make a role based authentication system. which uses mongoDB to store user details and password is hashed for security. (DONE)
#### -> login/logout functionality (DONE)..only now we need to sync them in frontend.
(Is this workflow ok ? - [ ? ]).
